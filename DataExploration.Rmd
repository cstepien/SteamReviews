## Pulling the data

We'll use the Steam Spy API to get the dataset of all games on Steam and the estimated number of owners for each game.  This site doesn't have a published API client, so we just need to call the data directly. 

```{r}
library(httr)
spy_url <-"http://steamspy.com/api.php?request=appdetails&appid=730"
single_game <- content(GET(url = spy_url))
```

## Initial Visualization

We'll take a preliminary look at the relationship between reviews and number of owners. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
```
